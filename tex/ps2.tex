\chapter{PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse}

The \jr\ provides a single PS/2 port for use with either a keyboard or a mouse. This port is accessed through five registers, which provide very simple access to a PS/2 device. The \jr\ does not have a full PS/2 controller, but instead provides mostly raw access to the data stream. It does make some attempt to translate set 2 scan codes to ASCII character code, although raw scan codes may be read instead.

\begin{description}
    \item[WR]
    \item[RD]
    \item[TX\_ACK] when 1, the code sent to the keyboard has been acknowledged
    \item[TX\_NAK] when 1, the code sent to the keyboard has resulted in an error
    \item[REL] when 1, the key has been released
    \item[PRS] when 1, key is pressed
    \item[SHFT] when 1, one the shift key is pressed
    \item[RDY] when 1, Data to be read (will clear after you set the Read Strobe)

\section*{Mouse Support}

The \jr\ provides special support for a PS\\2 mouse, including support for a hardware mouse pointer.

This is currently done with magic, the details of which will be made apparent when the stars are in proper alignment.
