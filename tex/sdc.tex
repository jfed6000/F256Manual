\chapter{SD Card Interface}

TinyVicky includes an interface to the SD card port on \jr. This interface provides access to the SPI bus interface SD cards support. This interface will allow a program to exchange bytes of data with an SD card using one of two clock speeds for the transfer rate (400 kHz or 12.5 MHz).  Use of these registers requires an understanding of the SD card protocols and conventions, which are really outside the scope of this manual. So only the basic information about the control registers are provided here.

\begin{description}
    \item[CS\_EN] This bit controls the chip select input on the SD card. If clear (0), the SD card is disabled. If set (1), the SD card is enabled.
    \item[SPI\_CLK] This bit controls the clock speed for the SPI interface to the SD card. If set (1), the clock speed is 400 kHz. If clear (0), the clock speed is 12.5 MHz.
    \item[SPI\_BUSY] This read only bit indicates if the SPI bus is busy exchanging bits with the SD card. The SPI\_DATA register will not be ready for access while SPI\_BUSY is set (1).
    \item[SPI\_DATA] this register is for the data to exchange with the SD card. A byte written to this register will be send to the SD card. The data read from this register are the bits received from the SD card. If SPI\_BUSY is set, the program must way until SPI\_BUSY is clear before reading or writing data to this register
\end{description}

NOTE: The system control registers have two bits relevant to the SD card interface: SD\_WP, which indicates the write-protect status of the card, and SD\_CD which indicates if a card is detected in the slot. See table~\ref{tab:sys_ctrl_reg} for details.
